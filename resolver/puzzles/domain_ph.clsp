(mod (RELATIVE_EXPIRY_SECONDS DOMAIN_NAME)
    ; this puzzle does not really do a lot, however i thought it would be nice to be able to easily clean up the dust

    (include condition_codes.clvm)

    ; main
    (list
        (list ASSERT_SECONDS_RELATIVE RELATIVE_EXPIRY_SECONDS)
        (list ASSERT_MY_AMOUNT 1)
        (list CREATE_COIN_ANNOUNCEMENT (sha256 DOMAIN_NAME))
        (list RESERVE_FEE 1)
    )
)
